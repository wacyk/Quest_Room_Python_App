# Questroom Python_App

This window application is part of the Questroom hardware and software complex, developed by me in 2017

The questroom consists of many controllers interconnected via modbus-rtu, such as:

--digital inputs/outputs;

--combination locks;

--RFID readers;

--dimmers;

--phones.

All of theese modules were also full-developed by me as a part of this project
