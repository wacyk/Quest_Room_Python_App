# Questroom Python_App

This window application is part of the Questroom hardware and software complex, developed by me in 2017.
Questroom Automation Project: Spearheaded the end-to-end automation of a Questroom, including the
design and fabrication of all hardware components from scratch. Developed and implemented a custom Win-
dows application in Python, serving as the operator interface for the Questroom. The system integrated various
controllers (digital I/Os, combination locks, RFID readers, dimmers, etc., which were based on STM32 microcon-
trollers) via Modbus-RTU protocol, significantly enhancing the interactive experience of the quest game. This
comprehensive project showcases expertise in hardware design, software development, and system integration,
providing a seamless and engaging user experience.
